# ðŸ§  Mental Health and the Workplace: Predicting Depression Risk

In recent years, mental health has become a growing concern in modern workplaces. With increasing awareness of how stress, long hours, and lack of work-life balance affect well-being, this project seeks to understand the factors that may contribute to depression among working individuals.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to explore how different lifestyle and occupational factors relate to depression risk. By analyzing real data, the intention is to identify key variables â€” such as sleep duration, profession, age, gender, and education â€” that may serve as indicators of vulnerability to mental health struggles. 

Ultimately, the aim is to use data to support early detection, prevention strategies, and better mental health awareness in professional environments.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Playground Series S4E11](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11)
- The dataset includes lifestyle and demographic information, along with a depression indicator.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  

## Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering and Transformation  
4. Model Building and Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
5. Visualizing Insights and Findings  

## Key Questions

- Are there specific professions or age groups more prone to depression?
- Does poor sleep duration correlate strongly with depressive symptoms?
- Can machine learning models help flag potential mental health risks early?

## Future Work

This project is an early step toward using data for social impact. Future improvements could include:
- Expanding to longitudinal datasets
- Including work environment and remote work variables
- Collaborating with mental health professionals for interpretability
